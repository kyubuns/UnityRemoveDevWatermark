Unity Remove Dev Watermark
===

Simply importing this package will remove the "Development Build" from the lower right corner of the screen.
This has a number of advantages,
- Development Build allows you to easily shoot PVs and take screenshots for the app store.
- No UI overlap with the game's UI.
- (Anything else?)

![sample](https://github.com/kyubuns/UnityRemoveDevWatermark/assets/961165/21325692-6fbc-4eba-998d-d8db412b6572)

The following platforms are currently supported

- Windows (BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows, BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows64)
- macOS (BuildTarget.StandaloneOSX)
- iOS (BuildTarget.iOS)

I hope this feature will be introduced in Unity official.  
But [this request thread](https://forum.unity.com/threads/remove-development-build-watermark-without-giving-up-the-build-option.944772/) has been neglected for more than 3 years.
