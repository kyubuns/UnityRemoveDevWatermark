Unity Remove Dev Watermark
===

Remove the label "Development Build" that appears in the lower right corner when you do a Development Build in Unity.  
This feature allows Development Build to take screenshots for PV and store.

The following platforms are currently supported

- Windows (BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows, BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows64)
- macOS (BuildTarget.StandaloneOSX)
- iOS (BuildTarget.iOS)

I hope this feature will be introduced in Unity official.  
But [this request thread](https://forum.unity.com/threads/remove-development-build-watermark-without-giving-up-the-build-option.944772/) has been neglected for more than 3 years.
