Unity Remove Dev Watermark
===

Simply importing this package will remove the "Development Build" label that appears in the lower right corner on the Development Build.  
With this feature, you can easily shoot PV footage or take screenshots of application store in Development Build.

The following platforms are currently supported

- Windows (BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows, BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows64)
- macOS (BuildTarget.StandaloneOSX)
- iOS (BuildTarget.iOS)

I hope this feature will be introduced in Unity official.  
But [this request thread](https://forum.unity.com/threads/remove-development-build-watermark-without-giving-up-the-build-option.944772/) has been neglected for more than 3 years.
